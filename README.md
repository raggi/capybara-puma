# Capybara::Puma

The sweet loving marriage of Capybara and Puma. Use a lightweight threaded
server for your Capybara request specs. Reduce select() spam from having
EventMachine running, but still get better performance than Webrick.

There are several advantages to this:

 * A minor performance enhancement in some environments
 * No more CTRL+C fail
 * No depending on really old gems
 * Readable backtraces

## Installation & Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    group :test do
      gem 'capybara-puma'
    end

You should no longer need (or indeed want) to specify Capybara in your Gemfile.
If you do, you could end up with out-of-order requires, that will make you a sad
panda running on Thin. If you do specify Capybara in your Gemfile (for example
to use the git repo), do that /after/ capybara-puma.

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capybara-puma

If you break the hook (it runs at startup), you can re-apply it by calling
CapybaraPuma.activate.
